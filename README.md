# Globox-Project
1. Project Background:
GloBox is an esteemed e-commerce company that specializes in sourcing unique and high-quality products from around the world. While GloBox is well-known for its boutique fashion items and high-end decor products, the company's food and drink offerings have experienced significant growth in recent months. To increase revenue and raise awareness about this expanding product category, the Growth team initiated the A/B test.
2. Project Objectives:
The primary objective of the A/B test was to determine whether the implementation of a banner showcasing key food and drink products on the GloBox mobile website would positively influence user behavior and lead to increased conversions. The control group, comprising users who did not see the banner, was compared to the test group, consisting of users who were presented with the banner upon visiting the website.
3. Methodology:
The analysis comprised two main components: exploratory data analysis (EDA) and an in-depth analysis of the A/B test results. The EDA aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, including the number of users per country, group test distribution per country, converted users per country and gender, and other relevant insights. The subsequent analysis focused on evaluating the conversion rates, average revenue per user, and additional factors such as country, gender, device type, test duration, and user retention.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Analysis of the A/B Test Results
In this section, we will explore the data and gain insights into the user distribution, test group distribution, and conversions per country and gender. The following SQL queries were executed to extract the relevant information:
4.1. Number of Users per Country:
The SQL query provides the total number of users for each country, ordered from highest to lowest. The analysis reveals the following user distribution:
- USA: 14,772 users
- Brazil: 9,434 users
- Mexico: 5,738 users
- Germany: 3,854 users
- Turkey: 3,732 users
- Null (unknown or not provided): 643 users
These results indicate that the largest user base is in the USA, followed by Brazil, Mexico, Germany, and Turkey. It is worth noting that there are also 643 users for which the country information is not known or not provided.
4.2. Group Test Distribution per Country:
The SQL query combines the "users" and "groups" tables to provide a breakdown of users in each test group (A or B) by country. The analysis reveals a relatively balanced distribution of users between the A and B groups in each country. For example, in the USA, there are 7,463 users in
group B and 7,309 users in group A. The distribution of users between the test groups in other countries follows a similar pattern, with slightly smaller but still fairly balanced numbers.
This uniform distribution of users between test groups is crucial to ensure that the results of the A/B test are not biased by an uneven assignment of users to groups. It provides a solid foundation for comparing the performance of the control and test groups.
4.3. Converted Users per Country and per Gender:
The SQL query focuses on converted users, providing a count of unique users who made a purchase, categorized by country and gender. The analysis highlights the following insights:
- In the USA, the largest number of conversions came from female users, with 372 conversions, followed by male users with 277 conversions.
- In Brazil, female users also led in conversions, with 196, followed by male users with 108.
- It is important to note that there are some users for whom gender information is not available (represented as "null"). The conversion numbers mentioned above reflect the total number of users who made a purchase, regardless of gender.
These findings shed light on the gender-specific conversion patterns within each country. However, it's important to consider that these numbers represent the total count of converted users, not the conversion rates. To determine the conversion rates, the number of converted users would need to be divided by the total number of users in each category.
4.4. Conversion Rate for Each Group:
To assess the impact of the food and drink category banner on user conversions, we calculated the conversion rates for each group. The results are as follows:
- Group A (control group):
- Total users: 4,728
- Converted users: 174
- Conversion rate: 3.68%
- Group B (test group):
- Total users: 4,860
- Converted users: 226
- Conversion rate: 4.65%
From these findings, we observe that the test group (Group B) displayed a higher conversion rate (4.65%) compared to the control group (Group A) with a conversion rate of 3.68%. This suggests that the food and drink category banner had a positive impact on conversions for the GloBox online marketplace.
4.5. Average Revenue Generated by Users:
The next analysis aimed to examine the average revenue generated by users in both groups. The SQL query calculated the total revenue, total users, and average revenue per user across all device types. The results are as follows:
- Group A (control group without the banner):
- Total revenue: $82,145.90
- Total users: 24,343
- Average revenue per user: $3.37
- Group B (test group with the banner):
- Total revenue: $83,415.33
- Total users: 24,600
- Average revenue per user: $3.39
Although the test group (Group B) exhibited a slightly higher average revenue per user ($3.39) compared to the control group (Group A) with an average of $3.37, the difference is minimal at approximately $0.02. Further consideration of statistical and practical significance is necessary before making a data-driven recommendation.
4.6. Comparing Conversion Rates and Average Revenue per User across Different Countries:
To understand if the impact of the food and drink category banner varies across different countries, an analysis was performed comparing conversion rates and average revenue per user. The SQL query joined the tables, grouped the data by country and test group, and calculated the relevant metrics. The results are summarized as follows:
- Country Comparison:
- Group B generally exhibited higher conversion rates compared to Group A, except for Turkey and the group of users with a null country.
- The most significant difference in conversion rates between Group A and Group B was observed in Mexico, with Group B having nearly double the conversion rate of Group A (2.039% vs. 1.123%).
- In terms of average revenue per user, Group B outperformed Group A in most countries, with the exception of Spain, Turkey, and the group of users with a null country.
- Overall Performance:
- Group B displayed a higher total conversion rate (4.65%) compared to Group A (3.68%), indicating that the changes implemented in Group B may be more effective at driving conversions.
- Group B also had a slightly higher average revenue per user ($3.391) compared to Group A ($3.375), suggesting that users in Group B may spend slightly more on average.
- Outliers and Anomalies:
- The group of users with a null country showed a higher conversion rate for Group A (3.806%) compared to Group B (1.770
4.7. Conversion Rates and Average Revenue per User by Gender:
In this analysis, we examined the conversion rates and average revenue per user by gender for both groups A and B. The results are as follows:
- Females:
- Group A (control group): Conversion rate of approximately 5.14%
- Group B (test group): Conversion rate of approximately 5.43%
- Average revenue per user: Highest among all genders
- Males:
- Group A (control group): Conversion rate of approximately 2.63%
- Group B (test group): Conversion rate of approximately 3.79%
- Average revenue per user: Lower compared to females
- Users with gender marked as "O" (Other):
- Group A (control group): Conversion rate of approximately 3.22%
- Group B (test group): Conversion rate of approximately 3.02%
- Average revenue per user: Moderate
- Users with missing gender information ("null"):
- Group A (control group): Conversion rate of approximately 4.31%
- Group B (test group): Conversion rate of approximately 5.17%
- Average revenue per user: Significant purchasing behavior, especially in Group B
The data indicates that females have the highest conversion rates and average revenue per user, suggesting their higher engagement with the tested banner. Males, on the other hand, exhibit lower conversion rates. Users with missing gender information also show significant purchasing behavior, particularly in Group B.
4.8. Device Analysis:
This analysis focuses on comparing the conversion rates and average revenue per user across different devices for groups A and B. The results are as follows:
- Device A:
- Group A (control group): Conversion rate of approximately 2.77%
- Group B (test group): Conversion rate of approximately 3.52%
- Average revenue per user: Lower compared to other devices
- Device I:
- Group A (control group): Conversion rate of approximately 5.85%
- Group B (test group): Conversion rate of approximately 6.47%
- Average revenue per user: Highest among all devices
- Users with missing device information ("null"):
- Group A (control group): Conversion rate of approximately 2.04%
- Group B (test group): Conversion rate of approximately 4.08%
The analysis reveals that users on Device I have the highest conversion rates and average revenue per user. Device A has lower conversion rates, despite having more total users than Device I.
4.9. Test Duration Analysis:
This analysis examines the conversion rates and average revenue per user for each group based on the duration of their participation in the test. The results are as follows:
- Group A (control group):
- Conversion rate: Approximately 3.92%
- Total revenue: Approximately $82,145.90
- Average revenue per user: $3.37
- Group B (test group):
- Conversion rate: Approximately 4.63%
- Total revenue: Approximately $83,415.33
- Average revenue per user: $3.39
Both groups exhibited similar test durations of 12 days. Group B had a slightly higher conversion rate and average revenue per user compared to Group A.
4.10. User Retention Analysis:
In this analysis, we examined user retention and its contribution to total revenue for both groups A and B. The results are as follows:
- Group A (control group):
- Total users: 24,343
- Retained users: 59
- Total revenue: Approximately $82,146
- Total revenue from retained users: Approximately $7,399
- Group B (test group):
- Total users: 24,600
- Retained users: 80
- Total revenue: Approximately $83,415
- Total revenue from retained users: Approximately $8,401
This again indicates that retained users in Group B contributed more to the total revenue than those in Group A. In conclusion, it appears that Group B performed better than Group A in terms of user retention and revenue generation. This could be an indication that the change tested in Group B was more effective in engaging users and motivating them to make purchases. However, the exact cause of this difference would require further investigation, such as understanding the nature of the change tested and the characteristics of the users in each group.
5. Hypothesis Testing (Python)
In this section, we will perform a hypothesis test using a t-test to compare the means of the 'Spent' column for groups A and B. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the means are equal, while the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the means are not equal. The results are as follows:
- T-test statistic: -0.0596964133699201
- P-value: 0.9523976714075935
The p-value of 0.95 is quite large, indicating that we cannot reject the null hypothesis. This means that there is not a statistically significant difference in the average spending between Group A and Group B. A p-value greater than 0.05 typically suggests weak evidence against the null hypothesis, and we fail to reject it. Thus, the average spending of the two groups is not statistically significantly different.
Additionally, we calculated the 95% confidence interval for the difference in means, which ranges from -0.457 to 0.430. This means that we are 95% confident that the true difference in average spending between Group A and Group B lies within this interval. Since the interval includes 0, we can conclude that the difference is not statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. This aligns with the results from the t-test.
In other words, the data does not provide strong evidence to suggest that the average spending in the two groups is different. Therefore, the presence of the food and drink category banner at the top of the website, which is the main difference between the two groups, does not seem to have a significant impact on the amount spent by the users.
